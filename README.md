BillMate (WDI First Project)
============================

Heroku site: https://billmate.herokuapp.com/
------------

BillMate is an application to calculate house members' monthly expenses. A user creates a house profile and enters the roommates' names. Monthly house expenses (i.e. utilities, supplies, fines, etc.) can be recorded, and BillMate will run the numbers to determine who owes what.

Technologies:
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Devise Gem

Going forward with this project, I intend to add the following features so that this app can become even more useful to myself and other "group house accountants."

- Roommate authorization: allow all house members to add their individual expenses (i.e. the supplies they bought)

- Log of house notes: the house profile will have a second page of notes to record anything related to the house (i.e. repairs, issues brought up to the landlord, etc.)

- Rent email reminder: generates reminder email to roommates a week prior to rent payment date

- Utility Provider details: the house profile will have another page of information and comments regarding each utility provider

- Upload house photo: a photo can be displayed as the banner.
