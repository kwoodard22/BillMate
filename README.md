BillMate (WDI Project 1)

Heroku site: https://infinite-lowlands-6616.herokuapp.com/

BillMate is an application to calculate house members' monthly expenses. A user creates a house profile and enters the roommates' names and email addresses. Every month, house expenses (i.e. utilities, supplies, fines, etc.) can be recorded along with who paid each expense. BillMate will run the numbers to determine who owes what, and then will generate an email to all the roommates.

For the next phase of the project, my wishlist includes:

- Roommate authorization: allow all house members to add expenses (i.e. the supplies they bought)

- Log of house notes: the house profile will have a second page of notes to record anything related to the house (i.e. repairs, issues brought up to the landlord, etc.)

- Rent email reminder: generates reminder email to roommates a week prior to rent payment date

- Utility Provider details: the house profile will have another page of information and comments regarding each utility provider

- Upload house photo: a photo can be displayed as the banner.
